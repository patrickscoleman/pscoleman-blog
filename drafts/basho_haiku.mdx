# Basho Haiku Translations

<small>February 13th, 2023</small>

草の戸も 住み替る代ぞ 雛の家

I left my thatched hut
and moved back into the world!
It's now home to dolls

古池や 蛙飛びこむ 水の音

An old pond and there
a frog is jumping into
the sound of water

降る音や 耳も酢うなる 梅の雨

The sound of rainfall
It falls upon my ears and
the pickled ume

夏草や 兵どもが 夢の跡

Summer grasses and
batallions of soldiers are
but the scars of dreams
