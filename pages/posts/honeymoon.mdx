# A Seven-month-long Honeymoon

<small>
  <time dateTime={date}>February 18th, 2024</time>

Life is good. I’m at the tail-end of a 7-month-long honeymoon and currently sitting in an Airbnb in sunny Santa Barbara, CA. My wife, Courtney, and our dog, Mara, are sitting on the bed next to me as I type (along with some dog hair – sorry host, we’ll lint roll!).

Since getting married last April, we’ve worked, quit our jobs, and traveled to Asia, South America, and around the US of A.

I want to get some impressions down while they’re still fresh. This is mostly for the mems, but I want to share some of our joy with others too. It’d be impossible to capture everything, so instead I’ll go for the highlights.

I’ll start with now. I feel genuinely happy. But also a little tired. Somehow we’ve managed to keep ourselves fairly busy while not working. That said there’s also been plenty of introspective downtime. I feel like I’ve grown up a bit too (whatever that means). I’ve met a ton of people from a ton of different cultures. I’ve had to get out of my comfort zone, failed to communicate in many different languages, and generally been “on” all the time.

But I think all that’s given me more perspective on life back home. Hopefully I’m a little less caught up in the story around the busy-ness of everything and am a little more easygoing and tolerant. The world isn’t so big. We’re not so different from one another. And we’re all trying to get by.

Mostly I can’t believe I was able to run around the world for so long with the person I love. I know this is a rare and special thing to do. For that I’m boundlessly grateful.

But as anyone who’s traveled a lot can tell you, after a long time away, it’s real nice to settle back into your little slice of life back home. We certainly can’t wait!

Now let’s go to the beginning.

## July and August: Hawaii, Mexico, and Alaska

First we went to Kauai, Hawaii. It’s always been Courtney’s favorite Hawaiian island, and after visiting for the first time, I think it’s mine too. But gotta keep coming back for more research... We did a tough and muddy waterfall hike, ate a ton of poke, and read on the beach. Two friends, Brian and Ashley, joined us. Peak relaxation! Courtney wrapped up work a week after we got back.

In our first proper week off of work, we did more beach chilling in Sayulita, Mexico. Courtney’s friend Sierra joined us. Here we ate muchísimos fish tacos, took a surf lesson, and read and did yoga on the roof of our Airbnb. Book recommendation: [a dark and surreal Mexican crime novel by Yuri Herrera](https://www.amazon.com/transmigraci%C3%B3n-los-cuerpos-Spanish/dp/8492865695/) (en español, por supuesto).

Alaska. North to the future. Every year I go on a big backpacking trip with some friends. This year Courtney joined us (Patrick, Brian, Brandan, Will, Ashley, Katie, James and Susan) too. We went deep into the backcountry in the least visited national park in the country, Wrangell St. Elias in Alaska. We managed to avoid the grizzly bears, but not the rain (and even a bit of snow). Drenched, we bailed early for a roof and some hot food, but still had plenty of (type II) fun!

And finally a return to the bay. Who knows what the future has in store? But I do know who I’ll have by my side. And I do know where I’ll be living.

To the ups and the downs and whatever comes next!
