# A Seven-month-long Honeymoon

<small>
  <time dateTime={date}>February 18th, 2024</time>
</small>

Life is good. I’m at the tail-end of a 7-month-long honeymoon and currently sitting in an Airbnb in sunny Santa Barbara, CA. My wife, Courtney, and our dog, Mara, are sitting on the bed next to me as I type (along with some dog hair – sorry host, we’ll lint roll!).

Since getting married last April, we’ve worked, quit our jobs, and traveled to Asia, South America, and around the US of A.

I want to get some impressions down while they’re still fresh. This is mostly for the mems, but I want to share some of our joy with others too. It’d be impossible to capture everything, so instead I’ll go for the highlights.

I’ll start with now. I feel genuinely happy. But also a little tired. Somehow we’ve managed to keep ourselves fairly busy while not working. That said there’s also been plenty of introspective downtime. I feel like I’ve grown up a bit too (whatever that means). I’ve met a ton of people from a ton of different cultures. I’ve had to get out of my comfort zone, failed to communicate in many different languages, and generally been “on” all the time.

But I think all that’s given me more perspective on life back home. Hopefully I’m a little less caught up in the busy-ness of everything and am a little more easygoing and tolerant.

I’ve been reflecting on how... ...the tiny bubbles we all live in can start to expand ...those insurmountable problems we all face, well maybe some of them aren’t even problems after all ...the world is big, but it isn’t that big ...we’re not that different from one another ...and we’re all trying to get by.

Mostly I can’t believe I was able to run around the world for so long with the person I love. I know this is a rare and special thing to do. For that I’m boundlessly grateful.

But as anyone who’s traveled a lot can tell you, after a long time away, it’s real nice to settle back into your little slice of life back home. We certainly can’t wait!

Now let’s go to the beginning.

## July and August: Hawaii, Mexico, and Alaska

<figure align="center">

First we went to Kauai, Hawaii. It’s always been Courtney’s favorite Hawaiian island, and after visiting for the first time, I think it’s mine too. But gotta keep coming back for more research... We did a tough and muddy waterfall hike, ate a ton of poke, and read on the beach. Two friends, Brian and Ashley, joined us. Peak relaxation! Courtney wrapped up work a week after we got back.

<figure align="center">

</figure>

In our first proper week off of work, we did more beach chilling in Sayulita, Mexico. Courtney’s friend Sierra joined us. Here we ate muchísimos fish tacos, took a surf lesson, and read and did yoga on the roof of our Airbnb. Book recommendation: [a dark and surreal Mexican crime novel by Yuri Herrera](https://www.amazon.com/Transmigration-Bodies-Yuri-Herrera-ebook/dp/B01H65WGE4/) ([en español, por supuesto](https://www.amazon.com/transmigraci%C3%B3n-los-cuerpos-Spanish/dp/8492865695/)).

Alaska. North to the future. Every year I go on a big backpacking trip with some friends. This year Courtney joined us (Patrick, Brian, Brandan, Will, Ashley, Katie, James and Susan) too. We went deep into the backcountry in the least visited national park in the country, Wrangell St. Elias in Alaska. We managed to avoid the grizzly bears, but not the rain (and even a bit of snow). Drenched, we bailed early for a roof and some hot food, but still had plenty of (type II) fun!

## September: Korea

<figure align="center">
  <Image

  />
  <figcaption>이재야 생일 축하해!</figcaption>
</figure>

Our first stop in Korea was Seoul, and we met up with some of Courtney’s extended family to celebrate baby Eejae’s birthday (her mom’s cousin’s grandson). They weren’t sure if we could eat spicy food, so they made us some delicious pasta. But then when we met up with them again after a few weeks (and after telling them that that we eat "everything"), they gave us the works, including lots of kimchi, blood sausage (순대), chicken feet (닭발), and silkworms (번데기). It was all delicious! 맛있어!

<figure align="center">

  />
  <figcaption>sadly, we couldn’t take the hats with us</figcaption>
</figure>

We also met up with my Korean tutor, Min, for the first time in person. Min and her husband treated us to lunch at a naengmyeon spot (delicious cold noodle soup, perfect on a hot summer day, and profiled in [this Netflix food doc](https://www.netflix.com/title/81473619)). Then they played tour guide around Seoul and took us to a photobooth.

<figure align="center">

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Next we went to Sokcho on the coast. It was rainy so we didn’t get to hike in Seoraksan National Park, but while trying to get there, we did get ripped off by a taxi driver who at some point ended up on the phone with Courtney’s mom, explaining to her in Korean that he wasn’t going to rip us off. C'est la vie... When we weren’t relaxing in the hot tub in our room or walking on the beach we ate a lot of seafood. We went to an underground fish market and ate fresh squid (오징어), korean "sashimi" (회) and spicy fish soup (매운탕 maeunttang). Seriously, that spicy fish soup... Mmmmmm....

  </figcaption>
</figure>

After a brief stop in Gyeongju (a historic regional capital, with vibes somewhere between Kyoto and colonial Williamsburg), we made our way to Busan. We hung out for a few days, spent hours walking through markets, ate a ton of food, and then took the train to Seoul (since the train to Busan is overrun with zombie).

<figure align="center">

  />
  <figcaption>Jeju Island: the Hawaii of Korea</figcaption>
</figure>

Courtney’s mom, Helen, met up with us in Seoul and then we all flew to Jeju Island. Our extended relatives played tour guide and drove us all around the island. Food highlights included black pig (흑돼지), abalone (전복), udo peanuts (우도땅콩), and hallabong oranges (한라봉). Once we got back to Seoul, we hung out in Gangnam-dong (of Gangnam Style fame) and Seongsu-dong (the Brooklyn of Seoul, apparently). We went all over the city, but I feel like we still barely scratched the surface!

<figure align="center">

</figure>

We also snuck in a baseball game. "Our" team, the Doosan Bears, lost, but we ate a lot of fried chicken, followed along with the extremely well-choreographed cheers, and had a great time anyway! Just don’t get me started on how difficult it was to buy tickets without a Korean resident registration number...

## October: Japan

<figure align="center">
  <Image
    src="/images/honeymoon/ramen.jpg"
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="Courtney in front of two heaping bowls of ramen"

  <figcaption>
    we started feeling full before we even got below the top of the bowl...
    お腹が超いっぱいだよ！
  </figcaption>
</figure>

And then we were in Japan. First things first, we got convenient store onigiri at the airport, found our Airbnb, and then, of course, went out for ramen. Ramen Jiro had a ton of ratings on Google Maps and was in the neighborhood, so we checked it out. We had no idea it was famous and even has [its own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen_Jiro). Later when taking a ramen cooking class, the chef spilled the latest ramen tea and told us all about it. Not knowing what we were getting into, we ordered way too much, didn't want to offend, and ate until we could hardly walk. Totally worth it! Movie recommendation for the ramen lovers: [Tampopo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092048/).

  </figcaption>
</figure>

After running around Tokyo for a week on our own and revisiting some of the people and places from when I spent two months there just before COVID, Courtney’s younger sister, Brittany, and brother-in-law, Jonathan, joined us (along with two of their friends, Evan and Rachel). I was the only white guy in a group of Asian Americans and also the only one who spoke Japanese, which never ceased to confuse the Tokyo-ites we met. The highlights from this part of the trip were a phenomenal omakase (お任せ, which means leave it to me) sushi dinner, a trip to a Ryokan (public bath house) in Hakone (about an hour and a half outside Tokyo, up in the mountains), and a nostalgic dance-off on an old-school DDR (dance dance revolution) arcade machine.

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Next we went to Kyoto. We visited so many old temples, collecting [goshuin stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuin) along the way. We got dinner at a ["family restaurant"](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/10-popular-family-restaurants-japan/) called "Surprised Donkey," think kitschy chain restaurants with vaguely American decor, like Denny's. And we went to the famously photogenic red gates at the Fushimi Inari shrine, where we drowned in the crowds. We topped it all off with some tsukemen (ramen with the broth on the side) and some Japanese green tea (matcha 抹茶, sencha 煎茶, gyokuro 玉露) with sweets (wagashi 和菓子).

</figure>

Then Courtney and I were alone again, and we headed to the islands of Naoshima and Teshima to look at some modern art (think that old doge meme - much culture, wow). The highlight was definitely the Teshima Art Museum, a building that’s more like a wide open concrete sculpture with water droplets bubbling up from the floor. We lied on the ground for an hour or so and napped or meditated or something in between, and then hopped back on our electric bikes and took off. Oh and relaxing in the outdoor onsen (hot spring) at sunset in Uno, the port town where we caught the ferry, was a close second. Required pre-viewing: [an interview with Tadao Ando, the architect behind Naoshima's resurgence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kuLUrEGUOc).

</figure>

We wrapped up our time in Japan with a week on Shodoshima, an island with [a cute mascot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ddoshima#/media/File:Olive_Shima-chan.png) to honor its olive production, a day trip to Takamatsu, the udon capital of Japan, and a few days in Kyushu, the southernmost big island of Japan. Shodoshima is more popular with domestic than foreign tourists, so I got the chance to put my Japanese to the test. I was only turned away from a couple places for being a foreigner... and was mostly able to get by. We also forgot to get our international driving licenses, so we had to bike all over the hilly island on old, clunky, analog bikes. We read a lot too. I was chipping away at [Haruki Murakmi's new novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_Its_Uncertain_Walls) in Japanese, but it was tough and progress was slow, so I eventually put it aside and months later tried again with his [first novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear_the_Wind_Sing), which was much easier.

If you find yourself in Takamatsu, this is the place for udon ([Ueharaya Honten 上原屋本店](https://ueharayahonten.com/) + [google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qKue2VdJwceLtdcX8)). We didn't do Kyushu justice. I was mostly there to go to Kitakyushu for a new tatoo (of a frog with tatoos, from [Makoto Horimatsu](https://www.instagram.com/makoto_horimatsu/)) and we flew out of Fukuoka. Gotta get back!

## November and December: Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam

<figure align="center">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Our next stop was Singapore, where we stayed for five or six days. And I really must say it was nice speaking English again. Courtney spent a few years here growing up, so she took me around, and we even went to her childhood home, a highrise apartment building not too far from Orchard Road (a maze-like part of town with mall after mall after mall), which is where we were staying. Food recommendation number one: [Jumbo Seafood](https://www.jumboseafood.com.sg/en/home) (for chili crab). Two: [Hai Di Lao](https://www.haidilao-inc.com/sg) (for hotpot, even though it's an international chain). Three: any of the many delicious [hawker centers](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/hawker-management/overview) around Singapore (for everything you can fit in your stomach), shoutouts for Chinatown's People's Park Food Centre, the Maxwell Food Centre, and the Old Airport Road Food Centre. Happy eating!

  <figcaption>

</figure>

Next it was Thailand. We flew in to the island of Koh Samui, and our first stop was the Ritz. Fancy shmancy. We told them it was our honeymoon (we tried not to overdo it, but occasionally we really milked the honeymoon card (and mixed our metaphors)). Since it was off-season, we got a room upgrade, a free breakfast buffet, and a bathtub full of rose petals. Not bad! We were just easing into the relaxation portion of the trip.

<figure align="center">

  />
  <figcaption>
    the accommodations at Dipabhavan were a bit more modest
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Next we did a five-day yoga retreat at [Samahita](https://samahitaretreat.com/). We did yoga twice a day, worked out once a day, ate vegetarian food, and read a lot. I finished the book I'd been reading for awhile, Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, which was... a wild trip. A bit stressful and terrifying even. I recommend both, the book and the yoga retreat, just not at the same time.

Then we did a seven-day silent meditation retreat at [Dipabhavan](https://dipabhavan.weebly.com/). It was tough not talking to Courtney for a week but we smiled, made eyes, and flashed hand signals 🫰🫶 at each other as we passed on the paths, gently skirting the rules. I'd done my first meditation retreat at [Wat Suan Mokkh](https://www.suanmokkh-idh.org/) eight years ago and had been wanting to come back to Thailand to visit their other meditation center (Dipabhavan) since. It was definitely worth it. If you're into meditation or just curious, I highly recommend.

We finished our time in Thailand in Phuket. More beach and pool relaxation. Courtney’s friend, Brittany, and her partner, Mike, joined us for a few days. And we took a Thai cooking class ([thank you (kopkunkrap ขอบคุณครับ) to Tony's](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/577634)). It was a perfect way to close out this chapter of the trip.

<figure align="center">

  <figcaption>

    way to a work trip in Taiwan
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Our last stop in Asia was Vietnam. It'll be hard to pick highlights, but I'll give it a shot. [Pizza 4P's](https://pizza4ps.com/) in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi (it's that good). Getting hustled repeatedly in various tourist scams for coconut water, durian sticky rice, and Vietnam war history books. Listening to live K-POP covers in Hoi An. Meeting up with Courtney’s dad in Hanoi and Halong Bay. Getting a debilitating stomach bug followed by a debilitating flu. Listening to tourguides opine on the American presidential race. This random hole-in-the-wall [vegetarian place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WL1uyH7ACPFXcLyL7) in Hanoi. Really all the food. And our motorcyle tour, easyrider style (i.e. on the back with a guide), around Ha Giang in the far north of Vietnam (big thank you (cảm ơn) to [Dani and The Real Ha Giang](https://www.instagram.com/therealhagiang) who also made us hot ginger tea when we were sick). I could go on...

We were also supposed to visit Chongming Island near Shanghai to see my friend David and his wife Xinqing, who were there visiting her family, but due to getting this season's influenza, we sadly had to bail. Some day!

## Holidays: DC and SF Suburbs

## March and Beyond: Home, San Francisco, California

And finally a return to the bay. Who knows what the future has in store? But I do know who I’ll have by my side. And I do know where I’ll be living.

To the ups and the downs and whatever comes next!
