# Translation of the Genjo Koan by Dogen

<small>
  <time dateTime={date}>March 29th, 2023</time>
</small>

## Personal Note

Over the years, I keep reading and rereading the Genjo Koan. In translating it, I've found new meaning, nuance, and poetry in the text. If you're reading it for the first time, enjoy it and take it in. If you've read it before, I hope you find something new in my translation. May you be happy and free.

## Notes on the Translation

The Genjo Koan has been translated many times by many people in many languages.

I'm no expert on Japanese (modern or ancient), translation, poetry, Buddhism, Dogen, the Genjo Koan, or anything really. All I've got is my little bit of experience, so looking out from my vantage point, everything appears rather round.

I recently read [19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei](https://www.amazon.com/Nineteen-Ways-Looking-Wang-More/dp/0811226204) by Eliot Weinberger on the recommendation of a friend and was influenced by the idea that translators are often overly keen to introduce their own phrases and interpretations, changing texts liberally. Weinberger suggests that the best translators know that the original author could have written anything, even the alterations you're considering, and they didn't. They wrote what they wrote. And they meant what they meant, which of course we'll never truly know. Yet we try.

As such, I went for a more literal translation and tried to preserve word order and the variations in sentence structure where I could.

A couple early examples:

- Sentence 1: "すなはち迷悟あり" (sunawachi meigo ari) = "which is to say: there is delusion and realization"
- Sentence 2: "まどひなくさとりなく" (madohi naku satori naku) = "there is no delusion and there is no realization"
- Sentence 2: "生なく滅なし" (shō naku metsu naku) = "there is no birth and there is no death"
- Sentence 3: "生滅あり" (shōmetsu ari) = "there is birth and death"

I also tried to keep the poetic/visual imagery (e.g. "the home wind") where I could and indicate when Dogen used the titular phrase 現成 (genjō). I inevitably had to leave out or just plain missed some bits, meanings, and wordplay.

I was primarily working off of Kazuaki Tanahashi's [English translation](https://www.sfzc.org/files/daily_sutras_Genjo_Koan) for the San Francisco Zen Center, Nishijima's [English translation](http://www.cuke.com/pdf-2015/sutra-studies/Genjo%20Koan%20in%20Japanese%20and%20English.pdf), and these two translations to modern Japanese: one by [Sougen Yoshikawa](http://www.dogen-shobogenzo.com/genjyokoan1.html) and the other by [Hakuun Yasutani](https://www.sets.ne.jp/~zenhomepage/genzyoukouan.htm).

I consulted two dictionaries: [Jisho](https://jisho.org/) for modern English translations of still-used Japanese words and [Weblio](https://kobun.weblio.jp/) for Japanese definitions of ancient words (when definitions existed).

A few words were particularly difficult to translate:

- 現成 (genjō) – The characters mean "present" and "become," so "becoming the present" feels right to me. I think it captures both an intention of meditation, i.e. returning to the present, and an inevitable truth of nature, i.e. the present moment is all there is. "Just this is it," as they say. However, probably the most popular English translation is ["actualizing the fundamental point"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genj%C5%8Dk%C5%8Dan).
- 時節 (jiseki) – The characters mean "time" and "season," but I went with "this moment."
- 諸法 (shohō) – I'm translating this as "all things" as is commonly done. The first character means "various" and shows up in 諸仏 ("various buddhas"). The second character means "law" or "dharma" or "way" or "path" or "thing" etc. etc. 法 is quite the word to translate and I translate it differently in various places.
- 万法 (manpō) – This means 10,000 things, but once again I'm going with "all things." 万 was/is often used to mean endless, e.g. 万歳 (10,000 years! banzai! may you have eternal life!). Dogen frequently uses slight variations in words and Kanji to describe the same thing (or to capture multiple meanings), which creates rhythm and variety in the text. I tried to use different English synonyms when I could to reflect this, but sometimes (as in this case) I used the same English translation for different Japanese words.
- 行李 (anri) – This word shows up in critical passages (although all passages are pretty critical...) and was especially difficult for me to translate. I went with "follow the path." I've seen "practice" or "action" or "carrying on each day" and other translations. There are more explicit ways to say the path, e.g. 仏道 or 法, but I felt that "follow the path" captured the spirit of Dogen's words. The characters mean "go" and "plum tree" and one meaning of 行李 (kōri) is "wicker luggage." Maybe this represents what we carry with us as we move through life?
- There were many others, but you gotta call it quits somewhere ;)

In the past, I've also read [Dogen's Genjo Koan: Three Commentaries](https://www.amazon.com/Dogens-Genjo-Koan-Three-Commentaries/dp/1582438277/), which is a fantastic resource on the Genjo Koan, highlighting various translations over time. I can't recommend it enough if you're interested in going deeper.

## Do dogs have Buddha-nature? Woof!

        But just as one knows a boat advances when keeping their eyes directly

        From the bird there is life, and from the fish there is life.{" "}
      </p>
      <p id="jpn">以命為鳥なるべし、以命為魚なるべし。 </p>
      <p id="eng">
        From life there must be the bird, and from life there must be the fish.

      <p id="eng">
        One's life and days, practice, revelation, they are all like this.

      <p id="jpn">
        しかあるを、水をきはめ、そらをきはめてのち、水そらをゆかんと擬する鳥魚あらんは、水にもそらにもみちをうべからず、ところをうべからず。

        However, if after reaching the end of the water or the end of the sky,
        the bird or fish tries to move further, no further road nor place arises
        in the water or in the sky.

        If one reaches this place, one follows this path; this is the Genjo Koan

        このみち、このところ、大にあらず小にあらず、自にあらず他にあらず、さきよりあるにあらず、いま現ずるにあらざるがゆゑに、かくのごとくあるなり。
      </p>
      <p id="eng">
        This road, this place, it's neither great nor small; it's neither self
        nor other; it does not come from the past; it is not arising in the
        present; it is just like this.

        しかあるがごとく、人もし仏道を修証するに、得一法通一法なり、遇一行修一行なり。
      </p>
      <p id="eng">
        While things are like this, if a person practices and reveals the
        Buddhist path, attaining the path is surpassing the path, and reaching a
        step is practicing the step.
      </p>

        これにところあり、みち通達せるによりてしらるるきはの、しるからざるは、このしることの、仏法の究尽と同生し、同参するゆゑにしかあるなり。
      </p>
      <p id="eng">
        The place is in this: as one grows proficient on the road, knowledge
        progresses and knowledge halts; and as one masters the Buddhist path,
        this knowledge simultaneously arises and passes away.
      </p>

        What is attained and lost is certainly unknown and unconsidered by one's

      <p id="eng">
        While it's said that the proof immediately becomes present (genjo), the
        secret certainly does not become present (genjo); this much for sure is
        seen.

      <p id="eng">
        Saying, “If the nature of the wind is permanent, you shouldn't use a

        permanence and to misunderstand the nature of the wind.
