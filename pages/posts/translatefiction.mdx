# Building a simple app to translate fiction

Here's v1 of [Translate Fiction](https://translatefiction.com/). It's a simple little app to help me translate and study languages.

It's very much a **work in progress**. This'll stay a side project. I'll keep adding features that'll help me learn, and I'll share more as I go!

## What?

How it works. Coming soon.

## Why?

Recently I'd been wanting to take a stab at translating some more short stories, starting with ["The Second Bakery Attack"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Bakery_Attack) by Haruki Murakami. I like Jay Rubin's translation, but I wanted to try doing it myself (and to try making the language a bit more casual).

I started out with an [online dictionary](https://jisho.org/). Then I figured why not use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to speed things up a bit? It was still pretty slow going though.

Then I had a thought. Why not build a little app with the [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/) to save time copy/pasting unfamiliar or ambiguous words and phrases, making edits to improve the "literary quality," etc.?

When I was working on [Yaya](/posts/yaya), my co-founder David did all of the work with the APIs, and I focused on UI/UX and prompt engineering. So this time, I was looking for a simple project to work with the API code myself. This was small enough that I could do it all.

## How?

How I built it. Coming soon.
