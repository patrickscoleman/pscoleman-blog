# Basho Haiku Translations

<small>February 13th, 2023</small>

古池や 蛙飛びこむ 水の音

An old pond and there
a frog is jumping into
the sound of water

夏草や 兵どもが 夢の跡

Summer grasses and
batallions of soldiers are
but the scars of dreams

草の戸も 住み替る代ぞ 雛の家

I left my thatched hut
and moved back into the world!
It's now home to dolls

降る音や 耳も酢うなる 梅の雨

The sound of rainfall
It falls upon my ears and
the pickled ume

蜘何と 音をなにと鳴く 秋の風

Spider, how do you
sound and what is it you cry
into the fall wind?
