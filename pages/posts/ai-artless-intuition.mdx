Here's an uncontroversial take on all of the AI noise in the news.

This AI stuff is cool, but it'll stay in "assist" mode for awhile. It seems like most of the AI proponents are selling something (in that sense it feels a lot like crypto), and most of the panic comes from people who haven't really tried the tools.

Full disclosure: I'm writing this post in VS Code with [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) turned on, and it's suggesting an end to every sentence I write.

The AI autocomplete suggestions are occasionally on point, especially when suggesting something "in my voice." But I'm finding myself writing against the machine's suggestions, juking hard in the opposite direction and searching my brain for something fresh. Just to make it mine. Is this making me better? Who knows?

When I'm coding, I listen more. The AI's often right (let's call it 50-75% of the time). But sometimes it's just barely wrong and introduces hard-to-squash bugs. In these instances, I'd almost rather it be way off, which it is most of the rest of the time.

Most interesting work out there is work that's being done for the very first time anywhere, and at least for now, the AI is just synthesizing and delivering existing knowledge quickly. Churning out code or writing copy or even making boilerplate art or music is just not where the value (or the fun) is.

AI is a mighty powerful assist, but just an assist. The robots are not coming for our jobs <strike>yet</strike> any time soon.

Of course new works and businesses will exist that could not have existed before — think of semi-autonomous self-driving cars or solo/indie devs using AI-generated art and music to to do more on their own or local/small businesses using text-to-speech to offer accessible experiences they couldn't afford before or... I could go on.

I'm excited to see what people create with these new tools. And also for the inevitable countercultural backlash. As always, the [medium is the massage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message).

For a prescient look, check out the anime, [Carole and Tuesday](https://www.netflix.com/title/80992137) (2019), and one of its characters, [AI-assisted musician Tao](https://caroleandtuesday.fandom.com/wiki/Tao). We'll live in a world where we enjoy both human and AI works.
