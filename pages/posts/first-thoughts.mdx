# First Thoughts

<small>December 12th, 2022</small>

I can hardly call these my _first thoughts_, since I've been thinking about starting a blog and what to write on this imaginary blog of mine for quite some time now... But why don't we just get to it?

For as long as I've been online, I've enjoyed the nooks and crannies of the internet where people share their immediate, non-copyedited thoughts on handcrafted websites.

And as someone who never coded much outside the computer science electives I took in school (which, although fun and illuminating, were hardly enough to let me build anything practical), this world always felt a bit inaccessible. So after many years of posting on the big social media platforms, I decided to learn some web dev, and here we are.

Writing. On. A. Website. That I built.

I wrote the first draft of this blog post back in December, so I'd have some dummy content to test the blog with. It felt more important to me to have a website I was ok with than to just start writing... But now things are good enough, so it's time to give the blog a real first post.

For posterity's sake (and to show how long it's taken me to get this thing off the ground), I'll leave the initial date untouched. _I rewrote the initial post on February 7th, 2023, two months later._

## What's to come

I'm not sure what direction this blog will take, but I'm excited to have a place to write and share online. Here are some things you might see:

- **Pictures of my dog**: Her name is Mara and she's the cutest.
- **Startups**: I do business stuff (growth, sales, ops, finance, management) for startups and want to share some of what I've learned.
- **Translation**: I know Spanish, a bit of Japanese, and am just starting to learn Korean. I'm hoping to practice those languages here too.
- **Technology**: I'm having fun building this blog and working on a foreign language learning app as a side project with a friend. I'll share interesting updates on the process from time to time.
- **Travel**: I'm planning to be on the road for a while, so I'm sure there'll be some good stories.
- **Creative stuff**: I like to write and make art from time to time. We'll see if I work up the courage to post anything here.
- **Opinions**: We've all got them. I've certainly got them too. I'll try to keep them to a minimum.

## A wild opinion appeared

Ok apparently not that much of a minimum... Here's an uncontroversial take on all of this AI noise in the news.

Full disclosure: I'm writing this post in VS Code with [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) turned on, and it's suggesting an end to every sentence I write. The AI autocomplete suggestions are occasionally eerily on point, especially when suggesting text "in my voice." But I'm finding myself writing against the machine's suggestions. Just to make it mine. Is this making me better? Who knows?

When I'm coding, I listen more. The AI's often right. But sometimes it's just barely wrong and introduces hard-to-squash bugs. In these instances, I'd almost rather it be way off.

This AI stuff is cool, but it'll stay in "assist" mode for awhile. However, it is a mighty powerful assist.

I'm excited to see what people create with these new tools. As always, the [medium is the massage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message).
