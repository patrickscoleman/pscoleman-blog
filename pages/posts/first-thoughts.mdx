# First Thoughts

<small>December 12th, 2022</small>

I can't really call these my _first thoughts_, since I've been thinking about starting a blog and what to write on said imaginary blog for quite some time...

But let's just get to it.

For as long as I've been online, I've enjoyed poking around the nooks and crannies of the internet where people share their rough, unedited thoughts on handcrafted websites. I never coded much outside of a few electives in school (which, although fun, weren't enough to build anything practical), so this world always felt a bit inaccessible to me.

Then after many years of posting on the big social media platforms, I decided it was time for a change. So on and off over the last 6 months I started learning some web dev, and now here we are.

Writing. On. A. Website. That I built.

I wrote the first draft of this blog post back in December so I'd have some dummy content to test the blog with. After tinkering for 2 months (_through February 7th, 2023_), I feel good enough with the skeleton of the site to start writing. For posterity's sake, I'll leave the initial date untouched.

## What to expect

I'm not entirely sure what direction this blog will take, but I'm excited to have a place to write and share online. Here are some things you might see:

- **Pictures of my dog**: Her name is Mara and she's the cutest
- **Startups**: I do business stuff (growth, sales, ops, finance, management) for startups
- **Translation**: español (llena de errores bien intencionados), 日本語（まあまあ）、한국어 (아주 나쁜)
- **Software**: Occasional code snippets from this blog and a language learning app I'm building on the side with a friend
- **Travel**: Adventure stories (with photos and lithographs)
- **Creative stuff**: TBD if I work up the courage to post anything I write or draw
- **Opinions**: We've all got them. I do too. I'll try to keep them to a minimum.

## A wild opinion appeared

Ok apparently not that much of a minimum... We'll start with an uncontroversial take on all of the AI noise in the news.

This AI stuff is cool, but it'll stay in "assist" mode for awhile.

Full disclosure: I'm writing this post in VS Code with [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) turned on, and it's suggesting an end to every sentence I write.

The AI autocomplete suggestions are occasionally eerily on point, especially when suggesting text "in my voice." But I'm finding myself writing against the machine's suggestions, juking hard and racking my brain for something fresh. Just to make it mine. Is this making me better? Who knows?

When I'm coding, I listen more. The AI's often right (let's call it 50-75% of the time). But sometimes it's just barely wrong and introduces hard-to-squash bugs. In these instances, I'd almost rather it be way off, which it is most of the rest of the time.

I've talked to a lot of friends who work as software engineers or in creative fields. They're mostly all excited to use the AI tools, but they're also very aware that they're really not going to make their lives all that much easier. Most interesting work is being done for the very first time anywhere, and at least for now, the AI is just synthesizing and delivering existing knowledge. Churning out code or writing copy or even making boilerplate art or music is just not where the value (or the fun) is. You can tell the AI what to do. But you have to tell it exactly what you need. And even then it's lossy and indeterminate.

It's a mighty powerful assist, but just an assist. The robots are not coming for our jobs <strike>yet</strike> any time soon.

I'm excited to see what people create with these new tools. And for the inevitable countercultural backlash. As always, the [medium is the massage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message).

For a prescient look, check out the anime, [Carole and Tuesday](https://www.netflix.com/title/80992137), and [AI-assisted musician Tao](https://caroleandtuesday.fandom.com/wiki/Tao).
