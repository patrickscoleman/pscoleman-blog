# What I learned building an AI language learning app

<small>

</small>

First off, what even is [Yaya](https://www.yaya.press/)?

Yaya is a language learning app that I was building with my friend [David Gaynor](http://freedavid.co/) for the first half of 2023. It uses AI to generate reading content at an appropriate learning level in (almost) any language. We built it using OpenAI's ChatGPT and NextJS (more on that [below](#how-we-built-it)).

So you can get a better idea of how it works, here's a short video overview of the app.

## Prologue

The seeds for Yaya were planted a long time ago. Let's briefly go back to the beginning.

I have an early memory of learning the French colors sitting cross-legged on the floor of a classroom way back in the mid 90s. But my interest didn't really take off until an "introduction to foreign languages" class in middle school in the early aughts.

First it was Spanish. I studied all through high school and college, picking up a minor in Spanish literature (talk to me about writers like Jorge Luis Borges or Roberto Bolaño anytime). Then in my middle-ish-not quite-late-twenties, I started learning Japanese and spent two months living in Tokyo just before COVID. My goal (recently accomplished) was to comfortably read a Haruki Murakami novel in Japanese. A few years ago, I started dating a Korean American (now married) and learning Korean too.

Then in the fall of 2022 (well into my early thirties), I was cutting back on some consulting hours and thinking about a new project. I wanted to learn to code (my background is on the business side of startups) and still wanted to tackle that Murakami novel. David and I had a catch up call, and I shared an idea I'd been thinking of to interlace foreign texts with professional, i.e. human, translations (inspired by [Read Real Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/read-real-japanese/) and similar books).

It turns out David had been using Harry Potter to learn Chinese with his wife before bedtime and had already built a simple prototype using Google Translate for the translations. I asked David to teach me how to code, and in the first few days of 2023 we started working on Yaya together.

In truth, I was fantasizing about Yaya turning into a wildly successful business this whole time, while also telling myself it'd be fine if this was all just "educational."

## Early iterations and missteps

**v0.1**

The first version of Yaya matched and interlaced text in two languages. It let you upload the text of a story, novel, or any content in another language plus text for the translation, and it would give you sentence by sentence mappings.

David and another friend built the proof of concept as a weekend project using sentence embeddings, a matching algorithm, and a simple web interface. I started testing it with Murakami short stories in the Japanese original and English translation. It was a bit clunky and didn't always get the mapping right, but it was enough to get started. It was really interesting seeing the techniques of the different translators too.

I plugged away on updates to the web interface (on my own and in pair programming sessions with David), and he added more features like an option to use Google Translate instead of the uploaded translation and an ePub export, so you could read on an eReader or app. We took turns tweaking the matching algorithm and got improvements, but with neither of us having PhDs in this stuff, we were only able to get so far.

Before too long, we realized this wasn't going to be useful outside of a tiny and committed audience. It was a ton of work to get or find DRM-free content with translations. Most readers of literature in other languages are already able to read original texts or will only need a tool like this for a short period of time as intermediate learners (unless maybe your job is writing/comparing translations, e.g. in classical or religious studies). And we wouldn't want to ask people to deal with (or build the interface to fix) an imperfect matching algorithm.

**v0.2**

Next (for a short time), we pivoted to public domain classics that we could pre-upload in a variety of languages. The main issue here was that while we solved the problem of uploading content for the user, we didn't solve any of the other problems, namely that only a tiny audience (of mostly experts) wants to read classics in the original.

At this point we'd kept working and improving the interface. We had a solid app for reading foreign language content, but alas, no good content.

**v0.3**

So then we tried chatGPT-generated stories. I pushed back at first, because who wants to read the hallucinations of a soulless algorithm? Although the [Blake Lemoine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32198214) types may take issue with calling it “soulless”. That said, I quickly found that the AI-generated content was as good (or at least sufficiently good for learning) as a lot of the human-written bilingual graded readers out there. And it had something else going for it. Like the [library of babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/), it was infinite. And infinitely customizable.

At this point we had a "big" app that could do a lot of things, which made it a lot more complicated than it needed to be. David did a huge refactor and we cut nearly all the features

**v0.4**

From here on, we started getting the product in front of more users (who were not us) and making iterative improvements. We did a ton of "high tech" [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) to get better quality and variety. Some of the big feature additions were: [spaced-repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) vocabulary to include in generated content, flashcards, audio, and clickable definitions + grammar explanations for any word or phrase (also AI-generated). We also ironed out some kinks with poor performance in some languages (starting with AI-generated English content and then translating for those languages).

We had a good product at this point, but we struggled to get people to use it, which after all, is what counts. More on this [below](#what-i-learned).

Be clear on what you want

Get something in front of real users faster
The conventional wisdom is to ship faster and get feedback from real users, but I feel pretty good about our timeline. David and I were both juggling other work, life events (I got married!), learning (me) and teaching (David) how to code, and just having fun. Plus we’ve been using (and loving) the buggy unfinished versions of the app for our own studies this whole time.

Killing your darlings

AI art is still not quite there
candy house - “stockblock”, generating stories with gpt
We've been trying alternative ways of generating content, i.e. generating in English first then translating or generating with the source text and translation simultaneously. This has let us get something usable for the long tail languages, but as you're seeing, it's not perfect! ChatGPT4 is much better than 3.5 and we're excited to upgrade when we get API access. And very excited to see what's possible with 5 and beyond whenever that comes :rocket:

People don’t understand yaya - the chat metaphor is already the default expectation for something to be “AI” - Courtney’s mom thought we wrote the stories -

Overestimated my ability to learn to code quickly
Business vs computer science = trust the self that got you to where you are
Learn c++ in 10 years

focused too much on reading
most people want to speak and watch video
https://sdkrashen.com/content/articles/krashen_sla.pdf (compelling input)
duolingo is synonymous with language learning (people didn’t understand how our app was different from duolingo - which likely means we lost them before they generated multiple stories)
have to make language learning (which is hard), easy and approachable to get people in the door

## What's next

As for Yaya, David will keep working on it, using the features we built as a foundation. He's building an amazing tool for students and language tutors to use together and individually. Stay tuned for more.

As for me, I'm looking for work again (startup go-to-market, growth, and ops). Last summer I chose to [travel around the world with my wife for seven months](/posts/honeymoon) before settling down again. This meant pausing professional work and drawing down savings. David wants to bootstrap Yaya. And right now I need a steady salary. As you may know, life in San Francisco is a little expensive. But I love it here, it's close to family, and I can't imagine living anywhere else. So I'm happy to let David run with Yaya, while I turn the page to the next chapter.

All that said, I had too much fun hacking on this project. I'm sure I'll be buiding something from scratch again someday.
