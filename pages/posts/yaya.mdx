# What I learned building an AI language learning app (part 1/4)

Welcome! Maybe you're curious about AI, software development, language learning, or startups? Maybe you know me? Or maybe you just clicked a link? Whatever your reasons for being here, let me first tell you a little about [Yaya.](https://www.yaya.press)

You hear a lot about the big startup successes. This won't be one of those stories. In four blogposts, I'll share an inside look at when things don't quite work out.

## The evolution of Yaya

### Yaya v1.0

During the first half of 2023, I, [Patrick Coleman](/about) (a startup business guy), and my friend, [David Gaynor](http://freedavid.co/) (an experienced engineer/founder), built the first version of Yaya. It used AI to generate reading content at an appropriate learning level in (almost) any language.

We built it using ChatGPT, NextJS, and Firebase. And we bootsrapped the business, not taking any outside money. David was also teaching me to code during this time.

While we learned a ton, the first version of Yaya never saw the growth we wanted. I ended up moving on, and David kept going at a more relaxed pace.

But first, to get a better idea of how v1.0 worked, watch this short video overview:

### Yaya v2.0

On March 15th, 2024, David released a massive update/overhual of Yaya. The new version focuses on students working with language tutors. It's got a ton of features for language learners and tutors to use together during sessions and individually to study or prep.

Needless to say, we're very optimistic about the new version. [Give it a go!](https://www.yaya.press/)

## Some reflections

So what's next?

As for [Yaya](https://yaya.press/), David will keep working on it, using the features we built for v1.0 as a foundation. I'm excited to see it grow and evolve. I'll be using it to study Korean.

As for me, I'm looking for work again. I think I can offer the most to an AI, edtech, or dev tools startup in a business role (go-to-market, growth, and ops). But I'm open to anything with an inspiring team and mission. [Send me an email](mailto:patrick@pscoleman.me) if you'd like to chat.

I stepped away from Yaya last summer for two major reasons.

First, I realized that I enjoy working on the business side of startups more than I enjoy spending my days coding. David wants to keep Yaya small, so there's no need for a full-time business person.

And second, I wanted to travel the world with my wife. This meant pausing professional work and drawing down savings. David wants to keep bootstraping Yaya. I need a steady salary right now. Life in San Francisco is expensive. But I love it here, it's close to family, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.

I also want to say a huge thank you to David! He's been a true friend and mentor throughout this journey. I learned a ton hacking on Yaya and had a great time doing it. I'm sure I'll be buiding something from scratch again someday.

Thank you too for reading this first post!
