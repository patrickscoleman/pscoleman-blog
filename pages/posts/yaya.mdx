# What I learned building an AI language learning app

### Part 1/4: Intro

### NOTE: YAYA V2 LAUNCHES ON MARCH 15TH. LINKS WILL BE UPDATED THEN.

  <time dateTime={date}>March 18th, 2024</time>

In the first half of 2023, I, [Patrick Coleman](/about) (a longtime startup business guy), and my friend, [David Gaynor](http://freedavid.co/) (an experienced engineer/founder), built the [first version of Yaya.](https://www.yaya.press) During this time David also taught me to code.

> "Author: Yaya is a foreign language learning app that uses AI to generate dialogs, stories, and more. It follows the language learning principles of comprehensible input and spaced repetition."

> "Author: Well...

The truth is the first version of Yaya never saw the growth we wanted. We learned a ton (keep on reading), but in the end, we moved on from Yaya v1.0. I ended up moving on from the project too. David kept going at a more relaxed pace, and on March 15th, 2024, he released a [massive update](https://www.yaya.press) ([more below](#v2)).

You hear a lot about the big startup successes. This won't be one of those stories. In this blogpost series, I'll share an inside look at when things don't quite work out. If you're interested in AI, software development, startups, language learning, learning to code, or if you just know me, I think you'll find this interesting.

## The evolution of Yaya

### Yaya v1.0

The first version of Yaya used AI to generate reading content at an appropriate learning level in (almost) any language. We built it using ChatGPT, NextJS, Firebase, and a handful of other tools. And we bootsrapped the business, not taking any outside money.

To get a better idea of how v1.0 worked, watch this short video overview:

**The core user journey:**

1. Generate content in your target language
1. Read and listen
1. Study words and phrases you don't know

The new version of Yaya focuses on students working with language tutors. It's got a ton of features for language learners and tutors to use together during sessions and individually to study or prep.

Needless to say, we're very optimistic. [Give it a go!](https://www.yaya.press/)

## Some reflections

So what's next?

As for [Yaya](https://yaya.press/), David will keep working on it, using the features we built for v1.0 as a foundation. I'm excited to see it grow and evolve. I'll be using it to study Korean.

As for me, I'm looking for work again. I think I can offer the most to an AI, edtech, or dev tools startup in a business role (go-to-market, growth, and ops/finance). But I'm open to anything with an inspiring team and mission. [Send me an email](mailto:patrick@pscoleman.me) if you'd like to chat.

I stepped away from Yaya last summer for two major reasons.

First, I realized that I enjoy working on the business side of startups more than I enjoy spending my days coding. David wants to keep Yaya small, so there's no need for a full-time business person.

And second, I wanted to travel the world with my wife. This meant pausing professional work and drawing down savings. David wants to keep bootstraping Yaya. I need a steady salary right now. Life in San Francisco is expensive. But I love it here, it's close to family, and I can't imagine living anywhere else.

I also want to say a huge thank you to David! He's been a true friend and mentor throughout this journey. I learned a ton hacking on Yaya and had a great time doing it. I'm sure I'll be buiding something from scratch again someday.
