# What I learned building an AI language learning app

<small>
  <time dateTime={date}>March 1st, 2024</time>
</small>

First off, what even is [Yaya](https://www.yaya.press/)?

Yaya is a language learning app that I (a startup business guy) was building with my friend [David Gaynor](http://freedavid.co/) (a very experienced engineer/founder) for the first half of 2023. It uses AI to generate reading content at an appropriate learning level in (almost) any language. We built it using OpenAI's ChatGPT and NextJS (more on that [below](#how-we-built-it)).

So you can get a better idea of how it works, here's a short video overview of the app.

## Prologue

The seeds for Yaya were planted a long time ago. Let's briefly go back to the beginning. ([or skip ahead](#early-iterations-and-missteps))

I have an early memory of learning the French colors sitting cross-legged on the floor of a classroom way back in the mid 90s. But my interest didn't really take off until an "introduction to foreign languages" class in middle school in the early aughts.

First it was Spanish. I studied all through high school and college, picking up a minor in Spanish literature (talk to me about writers like Jorge Luis Borges or Roberto Bolaño anytime). Then in my middle-ish-not quite-late-twenties, I started learning Japanese and spent two months living in Tokyo just before COVID. My goal (recently accomplished) was to comfortably read a Haruki Murakami novel in Japanese. A few years ago, I started dating a Korean American (now married) and learning Korean too.

Then in the fall of 2022 (well into my early thirties), I was cutting back on some consulting hours and thinking about a new project. I wanted to learn to code and still wanted to tackle that Murakami novel. David and I had a catch up call, and I shared an idea I'd been thinking of to interlace foreign texts with professional, i.e. human, translations (inspired by [Read Real Japanese](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/read-real-japanese/) and similar books).

It turns out David had been using Harry Potter to learn Chinese with his wife before bedtime and had already built a simple prototype using Google Translate for the translations. I asked David to teach me how to code, and in the first few days of 2023 we started working on Yaya together.

In truth, I was fantasizing about Yaya turning into a wildly successful business this whole time, while also telling myself it'd be fine if this was all just "educational."

## Early iterations and missteps

### v0.1

The first version of Yaya matched and interlaced text in two languages. It let you upload the text of a story, novel, or any content in another language plus text for the translation, and it would give you sentence by sentence mappings.

David and another friend built the proof of concept as a weekend project using sentence embeddings, a matching algorithm ([beam search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search)), and a simple web interface. I started testing it with Murakami short stories in the Japanese original and English translation. It was a bit clunky and didn't always get the mapping right, but it was enough to get started. It was really interesting seeing the techniques of the different translators too.

I plugged away on updates to the web interface (on my own and in pair programming sessions with David), and he added more features like an option to use Google Translate instead of the uploaded translation and an ePub export, so you could read on an eReader or app. We took turns tweaking the matching algorithm and got improvements, but with neither of us having PhDs in this stuff, we were only able to get so far.

Before too long, we realized this wasn't going to be useful outside of a tiny and committed audience. It was a ton of work to get or find DRM-free content with translations. Most readers of literature in other languages are already able to read original texts or will only need a tool like this for a short period of time as intermediate learners (unless maybe your job is writing/comparing translations, e.g. in classical or religious studies). And we wouldn't want to ask people to deal with (or build the interface to fix) an imperfect matching algorithm.

### v0.2

Next (for a short time), we pivoted to public domain classics that we could pre-upload in a variety of languages. The main issue here was that while we solved the problem of uploading content for the user, we didn't solve any of the other problems, namely that only a tiny audience (of mostly experts) wants to read classics in the original.

At this point we'd kept plugging away and improving the interface. We had a working app for reading foreign language content, but alas, no good content.

### v0.3

So then we tried chatGPT-generated stories. I pushed back at first, because who wants to read the hallucinations of a soulless algorithm? Although the [Blake Lemoine](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32198214) types may take issue with calling it “soulless”. That said, I quickly found that the AI-generated content was as good (or at least sufficiently good for learning) as a lot of the human-written bilingual graded readers out there. And it had something else going for it. Like the [library of babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/), it was infinite. And infinitely customizable (read space operas with cats to your heart's content).

At this point we had a "big" (i.e. bloated) app that could do a lot of things, which made it a lot more complicated than it needed to be. David did a huge refactor and we cut nearly all the features, except the core reader and AI content generation.

### v0.4

From here on, we started getting the product in front of more users (who were not us) and making iterative improvements. We did a ton of "high tech" [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) to get better quality and variety. Some of the big feature additions were: [spaced-repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) vocabulary to include in generated content, flashcards, audio, and clickable definitions + grammar explanations for any word or phrase (also AI-generated). We also ironed out some kinks with poor performance in some languages (starting with AI-generated English content and then translating for those languages).

By now we had built a good product, but we struggled to get people to use it, which after all, is what counts. More on this [below](#what-i-learned).

## How we built it

Here are the tools we used. Since I was a beginner and learning to code, I'll also mention some basic tools that experienced developers might take for granted.

### ChatGPT API

We used [OpenAI's ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) (GPT-3.5) to generate the reading content as well as the definitions/grammar explanations. We did a lot of prompt engineering to get consistently good output. We were curious about [tools for testing prompts](https://community.openai.com/t/tools-for-testing-prompts/305309) to improve stability and consistency but had other priorities at the time. The quality was generally solid in popular languages (English, Spanish, etc.) but trailed off in less common languages, putting out weird grammar patterns or even gibberish. We were eagerly awaiting access to the GPT-4 API.

### Google Translate API

We used the [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) to translate the generated content into other languages. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough for language learning purposes. We were planning to pass in more context to improve the translation quality but also had other priorities. As I mentioned above, we also used Google Translate as a workaround for languages where ChatGPT was weak.

### Javascript

It's pretty basic, but we wrote the app in [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). If you're a total beginner and want to work on web apps, learn Javascript.

### React

We used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build the front end. It's the most popular front end framework for a reason.

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and other hot frameworks look cool, and the nerd in me wants to try them out, but you better have a good reason if you're not gonna stick with the defaults, especially if you're working on a team. (and React still hasn't become [an old dinosaur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/duenablomstrom1/2018/11/30/nobody-gets-fired-for-buying-ibm-but-they-should/) yet)

### MUI

We used [MUI](https://mui.com/) for the UI components (buttons, drop downs, menus, etc.). Pick a customizable and widely-used component library and save yourself a lot of time.

### TailwindCSS

We used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the CSS styles (colors, sizes, layout, etc.). It's a great way to get a good-looking and consistent app without needing to be a designer. [Utility classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailwind_CSS) are just one way to do things, but I found it pretty easy and intuitive. It's worth spending time [customizing themes and colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) to make your life easier. Occasionally Tailwind didn't play nice with MUI (and vice versa) but it was mostly smooth sailing.

### NextJS

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a great framework for building React web apps that comes with a lot of built-in features that make development much easier. It's also great for SEO and performance (see [SSR/SSG](https://vercel.com/blog/nextjs-server-side-rendering-vs-static-generation), etc.). It was created by Vercel, so works best when you deploy there (more below).

### Vercel

We used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the app. It's a great platform for hosting NextJS apps (and other serverless apps). It's easy to use, has great performance (see their [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview), etc.), and is free for small projects. Deploying is as easy as pushing to Github (more below) and the [basic analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) are solid too.

### Firebase

We used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the back end, e.g. user authentication, serverless functions, and data storage in a NoSQL DB (among other things). It's a good complement for serverless apps. It was a bit of a learning curve for me, but it's pretty easy to work with the data in Javascript, the web GUI is convenient at times, and it's popular so there's a ton of [learning content](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=firebase) out there. David also had a lot of experience with it (and training junior developers on it) from other projects.

For an open source alternative, I've heard good things about [Supabase](https://supabase.io/).

### Google Domains

[This](https://domains.google/) is where we bought our domains. Google doesn't offer this service anymore, but there are tons of alternatives. It's a commodity, so don't overthink it.

### Google Analytics

[Google analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) is probably the most popular web analytics tool (although I've used privacy-focused alternatives like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) in the past as well). We used it to track traffic to the site/app and user activity. When you're using Firebase, it's good to stick in the Google ecosystem.

If we were a little further along and had the budget, tools like [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) and [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com/) would have been great for understanding user behavior and getting feedback. We did a lot of user testing and feedback collection manually.

### Github

We used [Github](https://github.com/) for version control and as a code repository. I learned the basics of [git](https://www.w3schools.com/git/), some [best practices](https://gist.github.com/mattlewissf/9958704), how to do [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and some collaboration etiquette from David. Github is ubiquitous and great. It also has a really nice [integration with Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github). Seriously nice.

### VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the code editor that most professional engineers use. It's solid and extensible. We used it too.

### Mac Laptop

Switching to a [Mac laptop](https://www.apple.com/mac/) after years of running Linux on the desktop was a little bit of an adjustment (ergonomically and ideologically :P), but I got a lot faster at building (not just the coding, but the collaboration and other work too) when I did. There's a reason why so many developers use Macs. ([more on my stubbornness and eventual transition](/posts/relearning-to-code))

Quick plug for [Rentangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) a nice little window manager for macOS. Definitely improved my quality of life.

### iTerm

[iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) is a great terminal emulator for macOS. The default app works fine, but iTerm just makes everything a bit more comfortable. I got a bit carried away with mostly unnecessary but fun customizations (like [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)). It took me back to the days of playing with [Compiz Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk1w) in high school.

### Figma

We didn't use it much, but for a handful of complicated page mockups and brainstorming, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was pretty essential. It's a great product design tool that scales up and down.

### Google Docs

Perhaps surprisingly, I mostly used [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) to keep track of work, burning through new docs almost as fast as stickie notes. David used [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and other tools. I'm a big fan of [Asana](https://asana.com/) (and project management software generally - very curious about [Linear](https://linear.app/)) in a professional setting, but with just two people in pretty constant communication, we opted to keep it simple. Use the right tool for the job and all.

### Tuple

We used [Tuple](https://tuple.app/) for pair programming. It's seriously great.

### WhatsApp

And we used [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) to chat on and off asynchronously. You definitely don't need [Slack](https://slack.com/) for two people.

### AI Assistants

And finally, I also used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) as a "coding tutor." If you haven't already, try asking ChatGPT questions and pasting in code snippets to get help with tricky problems and debugging. It's not perfect, but often it saves a lot of time vs. Google searching for blogs or digging through docs or StackOverflow. [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is also great for getting tips without breaking flow.

And if you're new, I can't say enough good stuff about [Replit's AI features](https://replit.com/ai) (dislaimer: I used to work there).

## What I worked on

## What I learned

[coming soon]

Be clear on what you want

Get something in front of real users faster
The conventional wisdom is to ship faster and get feedback from real users, but I feel pretty good about our timeline. David and I were both juggling other work, life events (I got married!), learning (me) and teaching (David) how to code, and just having fun. Plus we’ve been using (and loving) the buggy unfinished versions of the app for our own studies this whole time.

Don't spend too much time on the wrong things
Iterating on about page and company name, etc.

Killing your darlings

AI art is still not quite there
candy house - “stockblock”, generating stories with gpt
We've been trying alternative ways of generating content, i.e. generating in English first then translating or generating with the source text and translation simultaneously. This has let us get something usable for the long tail languages, but as you're seeing, it's not perfect! ChatGPT4 is much better than 3.5 and we're excited to upgrade when we get API access. And very excited to see what's possible with 5 and beyond whenever that comes :rocket:

People don’t understand yaya - the chat metaphor is already the default expectation for something to be “AI” - Courtney’s mom thought we wrote the stories -

Overestimated my ability to learn to code quickly
Business vs computer science = trust the self that got you to where you are
Learn c++ in 10 years

focused too much on reading
most people want to speak and watch video
https://sdkrashen.com/content/articles/krashen_sla.pdf (compelling input)
duolingo is synonymous with language learning (people didn’t understand how our app was different from duolingo - which likely means we lost them before they generated multiple stories)
have to make language learning (which is hard), easy and approachable to get people in the door

## What's next

As for Yaya, David will keep working on it, using the features we built as a foundation. He's building an amazing tool for students and language tutors to use together and individually. Stay tuned for more.

As for me, I'm looking for work again (startup go-to-market, growth, and ops). Last summer I chose to [travel around the world with my wife for seven months](/posts/honeymoon) before settling down again. This meant pausing professional work and drawing down savings. David wants to bootstrap Yaya. And right now I need a steady salary. As you may know, life in San Francisco is a little expensive. But I love it here, it's close to family, and I can't imagine living anywhere else. So I'm happy to let David run with Yaya, while I turn the page to the next chapter.

All that said, I had too much fun hacking on this project. I'm sure I'll be buiding something from scratch again someday.
