# Second Thoughts

<small>February 7th, 2023</small>

If you missed it, check out [part 1](/posts/first-thoughts). This post is a bit of a throwaway.

Like the last blog post, this one also started out life as a test dummy. It served its purpose well and has earned a permanent spot on the final blog.

I was going to add more, but... [something something second thoughts]

I promise you a proper post next time. Until then 나중에 봐요！ (_see you later_)

export default ({ children }) => (
  <PostLayout title={title} description={description}>
    {children}
  </PostLayout>
);
