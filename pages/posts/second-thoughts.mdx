# Second thoughts

<small>February 7th, 2023</small>

I'm only writing this post because the [NextJS tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/blog-data) wants me to have 2 posts. And well I also want to make sure that my blog template can handle more than just one page...

export default ({ children }) => (
  <PostLayout title={title} description={description}>
    {children}
  </PostLayout>
);
