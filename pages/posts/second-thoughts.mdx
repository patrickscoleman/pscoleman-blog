import { PostLayout } from "@/components/postLayout";
import { Meta } from "@/components/meta";
import { DateFormatted } from "@/components/dateFormatted";

<Meta title={title} description={description} />

# {title}

<div className="">
  <DateFormatted dateString={date} />
</div>

I'm only writing this post because the [NextJS tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/blog-data) wants me to have 2 posts. And well I also want to make sure that my blog template can handle more than just one page...

export default ({ children }) => <PostLayout>{children}</PostLayout>;
