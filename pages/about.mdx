# About Patrick Coleman

<small>
  Updated: <time dateTime={date}>February 17th, 2023</time>
</small>

Some professional experiences from my résumé:

## Startup ops & growth advising

[Interval](https://interval.com/) — seed stage dev tools startup

[Rime](https://rime.ai/) — pre-seed text-to-speech AI startup

## [Replit](https://replit.com)

**First business hire (#11ish) → VP of Growth**

Replit is an online coding platform and one of the most vibrant communities of developers on the internet. When I joined (a few months after the Series A), Replit was popular as a scratchpad and tool for teaching/learning how to code. I left about a year after the Series B, and the company had transformed into a powerful platform for building and deploying full-featured applications in any programming language.

Some things I did:

- Sales: 5x'd company revenue in my first year, set pricing, negotiated and closed deals
- Marketing: hired talented marketers, focused on social/content marketing in my first year, built-out attribution and reporting in my second
- Community: hired and managed the team that took Replit from 3M to 10M+ users (and put on some very fun events along the way)
- Product: worked with a small team of engineers to launch a new education product, hired Replit's first PM and eventual head of product
- HR: hired and helped grow a small but mighty HR team who helped set the foundations for Replit's culture
- Recruiting: went from conducting technical phone screens myself (poorly) to building a top-notch recruiting team, taking Replit from 11 to 70+ employees
- Finance: built the financial model and reporting that helped close Replit's $80M series B
- Legal: built a sales contract review process, overhauled Replit's privacy policies, supported Series B diligence
- Management: hired people who were better than me at whatever they did, offered a little training, and mostly tried my best to get out of their way

## [PeopleGrove](https://www.peoplegrove.com/)

**First hire → VP of Operations**

PeopleGrove helps connect students with alumni for career advice & mentorship.

In my first year and a half I did implementations, customer success, support, and a bit of sales. The next year, I led the sales team, closed some deals, and managed our event marketing (hitting the road to conferences at least a couple times a month). In my last year, I switched gears to finance and HR, built our first proper financial operating model, and helped the company raise a venture debt facility.

## [Market Track](https://markettrack.com/)

**Corporate development analyst / business generalist**

Market Track (since renamed) was a private-equity-backed data & analytics business.

I did a little bit of everything, including but not limited to: building Excel models, drafting board slides, sales ops (Salesforce admin), competitive intelligence, software implementations/project management, M&A support, and legal discovery/diligence.

## [Bank of America Merrill Lynch](https://bofaml.com/)

**Investment banking analyst, Tech Media Telecom Group**

Cranked out financial models and made (mostly) impeccable PowerPoint slides late into the night. Pitched some pretty epic hostile takeovers that never went anywhere and some more routine deals that did.
