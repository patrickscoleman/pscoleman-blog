### Career break

**World traveler** (Jul 2023 - Feb 2024)

My wife and I took some time off for an [extended honeymoon](/posts/honeymoon) around the world. We went to Korea, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Chile, and Argentina.

### [Yaya](https://www.yaya.press/)

**Co-Founder** (Jan 2023 - Jun 2023)

Yaya is an AI foreign language learning app. My co-founder and I bootstrapped Yaya. In its first 6 months, I helped with frontend coding (React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, etc.), user research, and product design. In July 2023, I stepped away to travel the world. Read more about [what I learned building Yaya](/posts/yaya).

### Startup ops & growth advising

[Rime](https://rime.ai/) (Feb 2023 - present) — pre-seed → seed-stage text-to-speech AI startup

[Interval](https://interval.com/) (Oct 2022 - June 2023) — seed stage dev tools startup

### [Replit](https://replit.com)

**First business hire (#11ish) → VP of Growth** (2020 - 2022)

Replit is an online coding platform and one of the most vibrant communities of developers on the internet. When I joined (a few months after the Series A), Replit was popular as a scratchpad and tool for teaching/learning how to code. I left about a year after the Series B, and the company had transformed into a powerful platform for building and deploying full-featured applications in any programming language.

Some things I did: **sales** (5x'd revenue in year 1), **marketing** (content & community, attribution/tracking), **product** (hired first PM, launched education product), **HR/recruiting** (took team from 11 to 70+ people), **finance** (financial model/reporting, $80M series B), **legal** (sales contracts, international/education privacy policies), and **management** (hired amazing people who were better than me at whatever they did).

### [PeopleGrove](https://www.peoplegrove.com/)

**First hire → VP of Operations** (2016 - 2019)

PeopleGrove helps connect students with alumni for career advice & mentorship.

In my first year and a half I did implementations, customer success, support, and a bit of sales. The next year, I led the sales team, closed some deals, and managed our event marketing (hitting the road to conferences at least a couple times a month). In my last year, I switched gears to finance and HR, built our first proper financial operating model, and helped the company raise a venture debt facility.

### Market Track

**Corporate development analyst / business generalist** (2014 - 2015)

Market Track (now part of [Numerator](https://www.numerator.com/)) was a private-equity-backed consumer/retail data & analytics business.

I did a little bit of everything, including but not limited to: building Excel models, drafting board slides, sales ops (Salesforce admin), competitive intelligence, software implementations/project management, M&A support, and legal discovery/diligence.

### [Bank of America Merrill Lynch](https://bofaml.com/)

**Investment banking analyst, Tech Media Telecom Group** (2012 - 2013)

Cranked out financial models and made (mostly) impeccable PowerPoint slides late into the night. Pitched some pretty epic hostile takeovers that never went anywhere and some more routine deals that did.

## Educational highlights

### [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/)

**BS in Economics** (2008 - 2012)

- Graduated summa cum laude
- Concentrations in Finance & Operations & Information Management
- Minor in Spanish with a focus on Latin American literature and culture

School was great, but I've learned so much more since then. A handful of topics have really stuck with me though, including but certainly not limited to: [corporate valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_valuation); [portfolio theory and statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory); [decision-making and game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making); [Roberto Bolaño's 2666](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2666); and [cyberculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_culture).
