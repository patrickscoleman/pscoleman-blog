          ðŸ‘‹ Hello internet friend, I&apos;m Patrick. This is my blog, and in
          it, you&apos;ll find my thoughts on things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s too early to tell for sure, but I&apos;ll most likely write
          about startups, maybe translate some haikus, share dog pics, keep a
          travelogue, and just jot errant thoughts down as they come up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so you know I&apos;m qualified to share the highest quality
          thoughts, please head on over to{" "}
          <Link href="/about">my about page</Link> to see what I&apos;ve been up
          to on my short time on this lovely space rock that we call Earth.
