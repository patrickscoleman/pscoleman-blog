          These days, I&apos;m looking for my next gig. I&apos;m a business
          generalist, which means I focus on go-to-market (sales, marketing,
          growth, etc.) and operations (management, finance, legal, HR,
          recruiting, etc.), plus I code a little. I think I can offer the most
          to early-/mid-stage startups working on language learning, devtools,
          AI, or edtech. But I&apos;m open to anything with an inspiring team
          and mission.

          Until recently I was traveling around the world on an extended
          honeymoon with my wife Courtney (and trying to keep up on my Korean
          learning). Before that I was working with a friend on{" "}
