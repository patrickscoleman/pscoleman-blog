          ðŸ‘‹ Hello internet friend, I&apos;m Patrick. This is my blog, and in
          it, you&apos;ll find thoughts on things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s too early to tell for sure, but I&apos;ll most likely write
          about startups, maybe translate some haikus, share dog pics, keep a
          travelogue, and just jot errant thoughts down as they come up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so you know that I&apos;m well qualified to share only the highest
          quality thoughts, please head on over to my about page to see what
          I&apos;ve been up to on my short time on this space rock that we call
          Earth.
        </p>
