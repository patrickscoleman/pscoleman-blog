I'm Patrick, and I'm currently looking for my next gig.

I'm a business generalist, which means I focus on **go-to-market** (sales and marketing), **growth** (product), and **operations** (management, finance, legal, HR, recruiting, etc.). Plus I code a little.

For a full list of my skills and experience, check out [my about page](/about). Or if you prefer, here's [my old school resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkfXnKlnLmttM4D3yToPcbr_uGJfQeVX/view?usp=sharing). Some highlights:

- Co-Founder at [Yaya](https://yaya.press/) (AI foreign language learning + [takeaways](/posts/yaya))
- VP of Operations/Growth at [Replit](https://replit.com/) (online coding platform, widely used in industry and education)
- VP of Operations at [PeopleGrove](https://peoplegrove.com/) (higher education mentoring platform)
- Investment Banking Analyst at [BofA Merrill Lynch](https://www.bofaml.com/) (tech, media, telecom M&A, debt/equity financing, etc.)

I think I can offer the most to startups working on **AI**, **edtech** or **dev tools**. But I'm open to anything with an inspiring team and mission.

I don't care too much about titles. Whether it's COO, VP, business operations, biz guy, or something else, I'll be happy if the team, product, and mission are right.
