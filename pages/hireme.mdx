Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Patrick! I'm currently looking for my next thing.

I was the first business hire and an early ops leader at [Replit](https://replit.com/) ($1B+ valuation, online software development platform) and [PeopleGrove](https://peoplegrove.com/) (higher education mentoring). Some highlights from my time at Replit:

- Led finance/diligence for our $80M series B ($800M valuation)
- 5x'd sales in my first year
- Launched a new product with a few engineers, set pricing & packaging, and grew it to be our top seller
- Managed ICs and managers

I have the most experience working in AI, edtech, and dev tools, but I'm open to any company with a great mission, team, and traction.

I'm a business generalist, which means I focus on **operations** (finance, revops, management, HR, recruiting, legal, etc.) and **go-to-market** (sales, marketing, product-led-growth, etc.). I'm spiky in ops. Plus I code a little. I'm a fast learner.

I am open to full-time or contract-to-hire work. I'm based in San Francisco and not open to relocate. I prefer hybrid/in-person but am open to remote work.

[Send me an email](mailto:patrick@pscoleman.me) or [book a time](https://calendly.com/patrickscoleman/30min) if you'd like to chat.
