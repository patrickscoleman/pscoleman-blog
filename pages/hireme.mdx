Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Patrick! I was the first business hire and an early leader at [Replit](https://replit.com/) and [PeopleGrove](https://peoplegrove.com/). Some highlights from my time at Replit:

- 5x'd sales in my first year
- Launched a new product with a few engineers and set pricing & packaging
- Led finance/diligence for our $80M series B ($800M valuation)
- Managed ICs and managers

I'm currently looking for my next thing and am open to full-time or contract-to-hire work. I'm based in San Francisco and not open to relocate. I prefer hybrid/in-person but am open to remote work.

I'm a business generalist, which means I focus on **go-to-market** (sales and marketing), **growth** (product), and **operations** (management, finance, legal, HR, recruiting, etc.). I'm spikiest in finance and GTM. Plus I code a little. I'm a fast learner.

For a full list of my experience, check out [my about page](/about). Or if you prefer, here's [my old school resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nCMSIGcdMxyzgZ9AhxRT-OZJxQYSE8vb/view?usp=sharing).

[Send me an email](mailto:patrick@pscoleman.me) or [book a time](https://calendly.com/patrickscoleman/30min) if you'd like to chat.
