I, Patrick, have wanted to start a blog for a long time, so these aren't really my _first thoughts_. But here are some thoughts anyway.

- **On blogging**: I want to share my thoughts with the world! _Why?_ :/ Why not!
- **On writing**: Writing is a tool for better thinking.
- **On thinking**: The mind is a wonderful servant and a terrible master.

Well, that's it for today. Cheers!
