I'm currently looking to join a new team. [Get in touch](mailto:patrick@pscoleman.me).

## Yaya

[Yaya](https://yaya.press/) is an AI foreign language learning app. My co-founder, [David Gaynor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runnedrun/), and I bootstrapped the business. I focused on software development (Next.js, Typescript, OpenAI API), product, and growth. Ultimately we decided that Yaya did not have the potential to be a high-growth business.

## Replit

I was the first business hire (#11) and VP of Operations at [Replit](https://replit.com/) ($1B+ valuation, online software development platform). Some highlights:

- Led finance/diligence for our $80M series B ($800M valuation)
- 5x'd sales in my first year
- Launched a new product with a few engineers, set pricing & packaging, and grew it to be our top seller
- Managed ICs and managers

## PeopleGrove

I was the first hire and VP of Operations at [PeopleGrove](https://www.peoplegrove.com/) (exited, higher education mentoring platform). I focused on customer success, sales, finance, and HR.
