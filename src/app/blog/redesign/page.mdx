NEW IMAGE

I redesigned my site to be more modern and minimalistic. For the UI, I used [v0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react). I also moved from Next.js 13 to [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14).

Impressions...

Overall I'm happy with the outcome and enjoyed working with these new frontend tools.
