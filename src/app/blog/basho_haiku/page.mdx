古池や 蛙飛びこむ 水の音

An old pond and there /
a frog is jumping into /
the sound of water

夏草や 兵どもが 夢の跡

Summer grasses and /
batallions of soldiers are /
but the scars of dreams

草の戸も 住み替る代ぞ 雛の家

I left my thatched hut /
and moved back into the world! /
It's now home to dolls

降る音や 耳も酢うなる 梅の雨

The sound of rainfall /
It falls upon my ears and /
the pickled ume

蜘何と 音をなにと鳴く 秋の風

Spider, how do you /
sound and what is it you cry /
into the fall wind?

寂しさや 岩にしみ込む 蝉の聲

Loneliness and the /
rocks even are soaked through by /
the cicadas' chirps

朝茶飲む 僧静かなり 菊の花

Drinking morning tea /
the monks grow silent among /
the chrysanthemums

富士の山 蚤が茶臼の 覆ひかな

At Mt. Fuji and /
fleas are on the tea grinder /
completely covered

旅に病んで 夢は枯野を かけ迴る

Sick on my travels /
over dead meadows, my dreams /
gallop, circling

fog sends things whirling about /
a bell is sounding
