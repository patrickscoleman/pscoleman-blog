# What am I up to in 2023?

This will be a short post. If you're visiting this blog for the first time, welcome. Check out some of [my other posts](/posts) too.

The big news this year is that I'll be getting married to the love of my life in April! We're celebrating right here in San Francisco with a small ceremony and a big party. Can't wait to bring our family and friends together to celebrate with us!

I'm also (re)learning to code. It's been quite a challenge at times, but mostly it's been a lot of fun! I'm finding myself getting lost in it in the best way. If you're curious how the journey's been going for me, read [my last post](/posts/relearning-to-code).

I'm also working on a language learning app with a good friend of mine, [David Gaynor](http://freedavid.co/), who's been teaching me the ropes. More to come soon.

And so I don't totally forget what it's like to have a job, I'm advising two exciting early-stage startups, [Interval](https://interval.com/) (dev tools) and [Rime](https://rime.ai/) (text-to-speech). Expect big things from these two.

On the hobby side, I've been doing a lot more yoga, a bit more climbing, and still learning Korean and Japanese. After 5 years of studying Japanese, it's tough to be a beginner again with Korean, but it's not so bad when "studying" includes watching great movies and TV like [Decision to Leave](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12477480/), [Singles Inferno](https://www.netflix.com/title/81436209), [Physical 100](https://www.netflix.com/title/81587446), [Kingdom](https://www.netflix.com/title/80180171), and [Crash Landing on You](https://www.netflix.com/title/81159258). If anyone's looking for a study buddy, give me a shout.

After the wedding, we'll be taking trips to Europe and Asia. I really can't wait!

I'll be writing from time to time and posting here. I'll also be cross-posting on various social sites, so follow along wherever we're connected. And at some point I'll add RSS and maybe an email digest to the blog.
